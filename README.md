# Project Title

An implementation of the CLIME algorithm proposes by Cai et al in "A Constrained L1 Minimization Approach to Sparse Precision Matrix Estimation" - https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jasa.2011.tm10155
This algorithm estimates a sparse precision matrix

## Getting Started

Run clime_test.py to see a quick test in action

### Prerequisites

Python 3 and virtualenv are advised. It might work in Python 2. The requirements.txt file should contain all the libraries you need
